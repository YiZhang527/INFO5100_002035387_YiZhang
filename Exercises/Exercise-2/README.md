# Exercise 2 - Shape Hierarchy

This Java program demonstrates the concepts of:
- Abstraction (abstract class Shape)
- Inheritance (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Square)
- Method overriding (calculateArea, calculatePerimeter, displayInfo)
- Polymorphism (Shape[] array)
- Static fields (Shape.color)

## How to run:
1. Compile all classes:
   javac *.java
2. Run the program:
   java TestShapes
